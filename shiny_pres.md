Where to Access the 'shiny_toy' Application
========================================================

The application has been uploaded on the shinyapps.io web site. It can be accessed as follows, with an authenticated login procedure:  

- URL = https://macrol.shinyapps.io/shiny_toy
- User = guest
- Password = dev_dat_prod

Description of the Application and Goals
========================================================

- Goal: visually demonstrate how K-Means Clustering behaves
- Offer the user a choice of K, the number of clusters, via a numeric input
- Offer the user a choice of the seed used for randomly picking the initial centroids
- Show the effect of the user choices by plotting the results of K-Means clustering

Additional Details on the Data and the Application
=========================================================

- The data is composed of 100 2-dimensional points
- These points were generated by bivariate normals centered around 5 means picked uniformly within a square range in the 2-dimensional plane
- The 5 normal distributions had identical, orthogonal, covariance matrices
- The original distribution from which a point was drawn is captured by the shape (triangle, square, diamond, etc.) of the point
- The results of the K-Means algorithm are shown by drawing coloured circles around the original points, with the colour indicating the cluster to which K-Means assigned that point
- The user input for K is fed to `kmeans`, and the user input for seed is fed to `set.seed` right ahead of calling `kmeans` in server.R


Final Slide Executing some R Code
============================================================

- Here is a plot of a standard normal! :-)
- Draw the sample mean in red and the sample median in blue


```r
set.seed(111)
x <- rnorm(200)
hist(x)
abline(v = mean(x), col = "red")
abline(v = median(x), col = "darkblue")
```
